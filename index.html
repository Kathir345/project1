            We definitely figured out a strategy that works! It works like
            bonkers, especially if you are running any kind of paid advertising.
            We do, and lots of it! We know a lot of our customers do as well!
          </p>
          <p class="par1">
            Even though this was working exactly as we planned... it took
            <b>TOO MUCH EFFORT!</b>
          </p>
          <p class="par1">
            Here is the reason why. Each one of those properties that are listed
            above have a separate upload process. Not only that but did you know
            that you can load videos inside of Facebook? You
            <b>ABSOLUTELY CAN!</b> We did this, and it was very confusing.
          </p>
          <p class="par1">
            We had to render two separate video because of Facebook's hidden
            limitations. Not only that you have some of your views going to
            YouTube and some of them going to Facebook! Then with Wordpress and
            cloud hosted sites, well that's a whole different story altogether !
          </p>
          <p class="par1">
            So we got smart and we hired a social media manager to do all of
            this for us. Her bill was about 14,000 PHP which equates to about
            <b>$300 a month</b>. Money wasn't the problem, the problem was the
            management.

                    Facebook is still THE Social Media giant. We don't see that
                    changing anytime soon. Therefore we made it possible for you
                    to instantly deploy your new video gallery to your fanpage.
                    Keep in mind these videos are NOT hosted on Facebook. They
                    are hosted on YouTube. So you still get the YouTube traffic!
